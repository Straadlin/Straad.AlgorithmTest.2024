## _Stacks, Queues, Sorting Methods, etc.._

This repository provides several algorithms to practice and imporve skills that we would like. This project was developed using C#.

## Features

- DosSum - We have an array with integer numbers and a target number, and we need to find 2 numbers inside of the array, in which the sum of these numbers are equals to the target number.
